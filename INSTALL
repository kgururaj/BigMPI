# CMake

Requires MPI-3.0 compatible implementation to work correctly. I have been working with
mvapich2-2.2a.

Make sure that the correct mpicc and gcc versions are in your PATH.

Ideally, cmake should take care of everything, but a config file fails to be produced.

cmake . -DLIB_LINKAGE_TYPE="STATIC" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc
./autogen.sh
./configure 
#Cmake "clean"
rm -rf `find . -name CMakeFiles` CMakeCache.txt
cmake . -DLIB_LINKAGE_TYPE="STATIC" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc
export CPATH=$PWD/src
make test
